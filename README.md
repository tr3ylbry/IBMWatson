# IBM Watson
Final Project - CSC483

Instructions:
1. Once this repo is cloned (link also given in the first page of the PDF included in the D2L box), the easiest way to run the project is to load in the pre-built index files (after unzipping) from:
  This link:
  
  
  To build the index files yourself download the wiki pages here:
  https://www.dropbox.com/s/nzlb96ejt3lhd7g/wiki-subset-20140602.tar.gz?dl=0 (and place them in the folder titled src/resources/wikiPages after unzipping)

Note: if you choose to use the pre-built index files, you will need to comment out lines 60-67 in Indexer.java
2. The 'main' class is Watson.java so once the file structure of the project is correct (after whatever zip files are downloaded), the program should be run from this class.

3. The program/menu prompts will guide you through the choosing the index and query methods; there isn't functionality (at the time of writing this README) for running different method combinations without re-running the code.
